## v0.1.1

- HeaderProcessor improvements
	- improved documentation
	- no more in-place changes (source include directory is never modified)
	- dropped backups as they are not needed in new structure
	- added -force-overwrite option to overwrite output_dir if it exists
	- in dry-mode, output_dir is not required and a dependency graph can be generated

- Made the following changes as per Sergey Lyskov's feedback (thanks!):
	- can supply output-dir (instead of transformation in place)
	- header guards transformations are now optional
	- can specify a list of possible header file extensions. Defaults are [".h", ".hpp", ".hh"]

## v0.1

- Initial releases
