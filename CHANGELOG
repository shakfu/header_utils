- Made the following changes as per Sergey Lyskov's feedback (thanks!):
	- [x] can supply output-dir (instead of transformation in place)
	- [x] header guards transformations are now optional
	- [x] can specify a list of possible header file extensions. Defaults are [".h", ".hpp", ".hh"]

- Initial releases
